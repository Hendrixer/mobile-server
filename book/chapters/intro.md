# Welcome

Congrats on grabbing [ng-newsletter.com](http://ng-newsletter.com)'s mini AngularJS cookbook. In this mini-cookbook, we'll walk through beginner and intermediate recipes to get up and running with Angular quickly without the fluff. As we walk through this book, we encourage you to try out the recipes. We've found that working through them helps both memory and understanding.

We had a lot of fun writing these mini-recipes and we hope you enjoy using them!
